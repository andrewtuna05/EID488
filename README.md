# EID488 - Convex Optimization Techniques

EID488 - Convex Optimization taught by Prof. Ben Davis in Spring 2025

Course culminated with a final modeling project. In this project, I chose to model optimal stat. distributions in AdventureQuest, an RPG game, with certain classes to find the maximum damage. Simulation coded in python using GNU Linear Prog. Kit, and Gurobi libraries.
